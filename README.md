### Info
The simulation is made with Unity and the framework DeepProbLog (neurosymbolic AI). I use ProtoBuf for communication between the C# and the python program. 
This repository only contains the Unity code. You can download the full program from: https://www.dropbox.com/s/0oq9ezifih3mlgr/SmartTrafficLight.zip?dl=0
